# Data Usage and Project Overview

We used 6 movie datatsets from Kaggle, one historial weather dataset from Open Weather

We chose to examine twenty years of data between the years 2000 through 2020. We opted not to go into 2020 as we knew our data would be skewed due to COViD. 

We decided to focus on a few major cities; Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Houston, Miami, Chicago and Phoenix. We chose these cities as the weather varies as do population and our thought process was that we would cover all bases for environment.

<img align="center" width="900" height="500" src='images/avg-weekly.png'>


<!-- Peak Revenue:  Weeks 25–30 (late June to July) are the most profitable, 
      driven by summer blockbusters.

Decline:  Revenues dip after summer, with moderate fluctuations 
      for the rest of the year.

Year-End Recovery:  Weeks 50–52 show a smaller spike due to holiday releases.

Seasonal Patterns:  Summer and holiday seasons are peak periods, while spring and early fall generate lower revenues.

Conclusion:  Movie revenues peak during summer and holidays. Distributors should prioritize major releases in these periods to maximize earnings. -->

**Peak Revenue:**  
The most profitable period for the movie industry is during **weeks 25–30**, which spans late June to July. This timeframe aligns with the height of summer, when studios strategically release blockbuster films. The combination of school vacations, longer days, and audiences seeking thrilling, escapist entertainment drives significant revenue during this period. The dominance of action-packed and franchise-driven films during these weeks ensures robust box office performance.  

**Decline:**  
Following the summer blockbuster season, revenues experience a noticeable dip. The post-summer lull is characterized by fewer high-profile releases, as studios avoid competing with the leftover momentum of summer hits. The rest of the year sees **moderate fluctuations**, with revenues stabilizing at lower levels compared to summer and year-end peaks.  

**Year-End Recovery:**  
In **weeks 50–52**, revenues rebound with a smaller but significant spike, driven by **holiday releases**. This period benefits from the festive spirit, family gatherings, and audiences with more leisure time. Studios often schedule family-friendly films, heartwarming dramas, and potential award contenders during this window to capitalize on audience availability and holiday traditions.  

**Seasonal Patterns:**  
The clear seasonal pattern in movie revenues highlights **summer** and **holiday seasons** as the most lucrative periods. In contrast, **spring** and **early fall** generate lower revenues due to fewer major releases and reduced audience activity during these transitional seasons.  

**Conclusion:**  
The analysis underscores the importance of strategic release scheduling. Distributors should focus on launching **big-budget blockbusters** in the summer and **family-oriented or award-worthy films** during the holiday season to maximize earnings. By leveraging these peak periods, studios can capitalize on increased audience turnout, ensuring strong box office performance and industry growth.

# Data Forecasting 

<img align="center" width="900" height="500" src='images/forecast.png'>

**Trends:** 
The model shows a stable forecast that aligns closely with most actual revenue data. This indicates its ability to accurately capture general patterns in movie performance across different seasons and years. The model effectively identifies consistent year-over-year trends, such as the dominance of certain genres and the predictable seasonality in audience preferences.

**Outliers:** 
While the model performs well overall, occasional extreme spikes in revenue, such as those observed in 2008 and 2014, represent notable exceptions. These spikes correspond to blockbuster releases that significantly exceed predicted revenue. Such outliers highlight the influence of major, highly anticipated films that resonate broadly with audiences, often accompanied by expansive marketing campaigns and franchise appeal.

**Model Accuracy:** 
The model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities for standard revenue patterns, but its performance diminishes in the face of unexpected blockbuster successes. The difficulty in predicting such spikes suggests a need to incorporate additional factors, such as pre-release hype, social media trends, and franchise momentum, into the forecasting process.

**Conclusion:**
The model is effective at predicting overall revenue trends and stable patterns in the movie industry. However, to enhance its utility, it must be refined to account for outlier events like blockbuster releases. Integrating data on pre-release buzz, franchise history, and marketing strategies could improve its ability to forecast exceptional revenue spikes, making it a more robust tool for industry planning.

<img align="center" width="900" height="500" src='images/season-peaks.png'>

**Graph A: Yearly Revenue Patterns**
The steady increase in movie revenues over two decades can be attributed to several factors. Inflation has driven up ticket prices, while growing audiences, fueled by population growth and expanding access to theaters, have boosted overall revenue. The emergence of premium formats, such as IMAX and 3D, and additional revenue from higher-priced luxury theaters have also contributed to this upward trend.

**Graph B: Weekly Revenue Patterns**
Weekly revenue peaks on Thursdays, coinciding with preview screenings for highly anticipated new releases. These early showings generate excitement and capture eager moviegoers, driving significant revenue. Interestingly, revenue dips on Fridays and Saturdays, which could reflect a shift as some audiences opt for Thursday previews or delay weekend plans for more flexible entertainment options. These trends highlight the strategic importance of Thursday releases to maximize opening-weekend revenue.

**Graph C: Seasonal Revenue Trends**
Revenue spikes in July (summer) and December (holidays) align with major blockbuster release schedules. The summer months capitalize on school vacations and relaxed schedules, while the holiday season benefits from festive family gatherings and end-of-year releases targeting award nominations. Conversely, January and April experience noticeable dips, likely due to post-holiday fatigue and fewer high-profile releases.

**Chart 2 & 3: Population Growth and Revenue**
An upward trend in both movie revenues and population numbers from 2000 to 2024 supports the connection between increased population and higher audience turnout. As populations grow, so does the potential moviegoing audience, further driving revenue growth. This is amplified by technological advancements in distribution, such as online ticketing and global simultaneous releases, making movies more accessible to larger audiences.

**Conclusion:**
Over the past two decades, movie revenues have shown consistent growth due to inflation, rising ticket prices, audience expansion, and advancements in theater experiences. Weekly patterns reveal Thursday as a pivotal day for revenue, highlighting its importance for opening-weekend strategy. Seasonal spikes in summer and holidays reinforce these periods as the most profitable, driven by blockbuster scheduling and cultural habits. Together, these insights underline the value of strategic planning in release timing and audience engagement to sustain and amplify revenue growth.


# Correlation of Genre to Season

<img align="center" width="900" height="500" src='images/genre-season.png'>
(Genres According To Season)

### The top 5 genres are, in that respect order: Action, Crime, Comedy, Drama,  and Adventure

As seen in the chart above: 
- During Fall:  Action and crime are tied for the highest viewed genres, with comedy as the second highest, biographies 3rd, horror 4th, drama 5th, and adventure 6th

- During Spring:  Action is the highest viewed genre, crime is the second, comedy the 3rd, adventure 4th, biography 5th, and drama 6th

- During Summer: Action is the highest viewed genre, crime is the second, comedy the 3rd, adventure 4th, horror 5th, drama and biography tie for 6th, and animation 7th

- During Winter:  Action is the highest viewed genre, crime is the second, comedy the 3rd, biography 4th, Adventure 5th, and drama 6th


**Conclusion:**

This Genre Analyisis clearly showcases the viewing habits of movie audiences, tends to favor Action across all seasons, with crime following closely behind and at times matching. These genres maintain broad appeal throughout the year, suggesting a steady demand for high-energy and suspenseful narratives.
Comedy consistently ranks third across seasons, indicating a year-round preference for lighthearted entertainment. These patterns can guide studios and theaters in scheduling releases to maximize audience engagement and revenue.

Note: In summer we see the appearance of both horror, and animation. An assumption could be made that perhaps audiences due to having more free time are more willing to entertain a wider genre range. 


# Correlation of Temperature to Revenue
<img align="center" width="900" height="500" src='images/rev-temp-weather.png'>
<img align="center" width="900" height="500" src='images/temp-rev-corr.png'>

### Bar Graph (Revenue, Temperature, and Weather) 
 - New York generates the highest 
 revenue despite cold, overcast weather, while Miami, with warmer weather, shows 
 the lowest revenue. Revenue does not appear to directly correlate with temperature or weather conditions, as cities with diverse weather patterns display varying revenue levels.

### Heatmap (Temperature and Revenue Correlation)
 - The correlation between temperature and revenue is -0.04, indicating no meaningful relationship.
 Temperature has minimal to no impact on movie revenues, reinforcing that other factors (e.g., marketing, audience size) drive revenue differences.

**Conclusion:**

Both graphs suggest that weather and temperature have little to no influence on movie revenues.

# Conclusion and Future Considerations


### Conclusion:

The analysis reveals that while weather has a negligible impact on movie revenues, holidays and seasonal trends play a critical role in driving audience turnout. Holidays, such as those in the winter season, create ideal conditions for family gatherings and leisure activities, making them a prime opportunity for film releases. Similarly, the summer months benefit from school vacations and relaxed schedules, allowing studios to target broad audiences with high-profile blockbusters.

Strategically releasing genre-specific films enhances box office success by aligning with seasonal audience preferences. Action films, with their thrilling and visually dynamic appeal, dominate the summer when audiences seek escapist entertainment and big-budget spectacles. On the other hand, Comedy thrives during the winter holidays, providing lighthearted and family-friendly content that resonates with festive audiences.

By understanding and leveraging these patterns, studios can maximize audience engagement and revenue potential. Aligning release schedules with these seasonal and genre-based trends ensures films reach their intended audience at the optimal time, ultimately enhancing box office performance and overall industry profitability. 

### Future Considerations:

We planned to utilize the Calendarific API data to analyze the impact of holidays on movie attendance. By incorporating detailed information about national, regional, and cultural holidays, we aimed to determine whether these dates correspond to increases or decreases in moviegoing behavior.

Our approach would involve cross-referencing holiday dates with box office revenue data to identify patterns. For example:

Increased Attendance: Holidays such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, and New Year’s often coincide with spikes in movie attendance, as families and groups look for leisure activities during time off from work or school.
Decreased Attendance: Conversely, holidays that involve outdoor or travel-centric celebrations, such as Independence Day, might lead to lower movie theater attendance as people prioritize other activities.
By leveraging the Calendarific data, we could have drawn more precise correlations between specific holidays and changes in audience turnout. This analysis would have allowed us to pinpoint which holidays are ideal for high-profile releases and which might require alternative marketing strategies to mitigate potential revenue dips. Ultimately, this data-driven approach could enhance studios' decision-making when planning release schedules to optimize audience engagement.
